# For this exercise:

1. Run `rake db:seed` and follow the error to identify the bug. Test out the assumption by running `rake db:seed` again
2. Once data has been seeded, run `rake console` and find the pizza instance with id 1 and store this instance within a variable
3. Invoke the instance method `.print_ingredients` on this pizza instance. What is this error returning and why?
