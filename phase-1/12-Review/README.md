# Phase 1 Review

### Deliverables:
- Add feature to allow users to submit a new item
- Add feature that updates an item that was bought
- Add feature to delete an item
- Application should fetch data from server and render to DOM

To use the mock-API:
First install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
To start the server run `json-server --watch db.json`
This will produce the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`
